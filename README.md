# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome. I'm Roger

Hi there! My name is Roger Rivl, and I'm a software developer. I'm passionate about building applications that solve real-world problems, and I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on.

Currently, I'm the creator of two projects that I'm particularly proud of: the DSN Europe App and the AF WHtR web app. The DSN Europe App is a tool that converts Defense Service Number (DSN) numbers to commercial phone numbers, making it easier for service members and their families to stay connected. Meanwhile, the AF WHtR web app calculates the waist-to-height ratio for users, helping them to monitor their health and fitness goals.
