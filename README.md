# Hi there 👋, Welcome. I'm Roger

Hi there! My name is Roger Rivl, and I'm a software developer. I'm passionate about building applications that solve real-world problems, and I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on.

Currently, I'm the creator of two projects that I'm particularly proud of: the DSN Europe App and the AF WHtR web app. The DSN Europe App is a tool that converts Defense Service Number (DSN) numbers to commercial phone numbers, making it easier for service members to stay connected. Meanwhile, the AF WHtR web app calculates the waist-to-height ratio for users, helping them to monitor their health and fitness goals.
